                Captivated by the power of technology to shape our world, I've been passionate about software engineering from a young age. From building simple programs as a hobby to pursuing formal education in electrical engineering, my drive to create and innovate has only grown stronger. I believe there is much more problem to solve using technological tools and my aim is to one day create solutions to one of human most ever ending problems using software.
